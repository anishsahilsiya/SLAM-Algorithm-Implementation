# SLAM Algorithm Implementation

Welcome to the SLAM Algorithm Implementation repository! This project is focused on demonstrating the capabilities of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in generating a map of a robot's path in an environment. It's an excellent resource for robotics enthusiasts and researchers interested in the practical applications of SLAM algorithms.

## Project Overview

The primary aim of this project is to showcase how SLAM algorithms utilize a robot's Odometry and Laser-scan data to create a map of the environment while simultaneously tracking the robot's location. The project involves a detailed discussion on various SLAM algorithms and their visualization on real robot data for effective comparison against a ground truth.

## Key Features

- Implementation of SLAM algorithms using robot's Odometry and Laser-scan data.
- Generation of environmental maps and real-time location tracking of a robot.
- Comparative analysis of different SLAM algorithm implementations.
- Visualization of SLAM results using Rviz.

## Technologies Used

- ROS (Robot Operating System) on Ubuntu 18.04
- Rviz for visualization
